React app 
As CTO for the outsourcing firm, I would approach this project by first designing the database to store the user information and payment details. I would create a table for users, which would include fields for the user's personal information (such as name, age, contact details) as well as their enrollment information (such as the batch they are enrolled in and the date of enrollment). I would also create a separate table for payments, which would include fields for the amount paid, the date of payment, and a reference to the user who made the payment.
Once the database design is finalized. 
To build a simple form in React for the admission form for the yoga classes, I would start by creating a new React application using the create-react-app command. Then, I would create a new component for the form and add the necessary HTML elements (such as input, label, and button elements) to the component's render method to create the form fields and submit button. The form would include fields for the user's personal information and their preferred batch. The form would also include a payment section, where the user can enter their payment details and submit the form.
Next, I would add event handlers to the form fields to handle user input and to the form's submit button to handle the submission of the form. These event handlers would be used to update the component's state with the user's input and to validate the form data before submission.
Once the form is submitted, the component's event handler for the submit button would make a call to a REST API to store the user's data in the database. To do this, the handler would need to use an HTTP library (such as axios) to make an HTTP request to the API endpoint with the user's data as the request body. Assuming that you have a mock function named CompletePayment() which accepts the details of the user and payment and simulates the payment process, the component's event handler for the submit button would also call this function to process the payment. The response from CompletePayment() would be used to determine if the payment was successful or not, and this information would be included in the response from the REST API.
Finally, the component's event handler for the submit button would return the response from the REST API to the front-end, where it could be used to display a success or error message to the user.
